# About
The Golden Minds Colleges Online Admission system was initially developed in 2020, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to enable students to enroll online during the pandemic when strict restrictions prevented in-person activities. In 2023, I was assigned to rebuild and enhance the admission system, taking on the responsibility of maintenance and upgrading its technology stack by migrating it to the popular Laravel framework.

The updated system now includes features such as sending appointment schedules directly to the students' email once they complete the online form, significantly improving the enrollment process's efficiency and reliability. I continue to maintain and develop this system, ensuring it provides a seamless and dependable experience for prospective students.

## Features

- **Appointment Scheduling:** Automatically sends appointment schedules to students via email after they complete the online admission form, streamlining the enrollment process..
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with an intuitive and responsive interface for easy navigation and use.
- **Enhanced Security:** Improved security measures to protect student data throughout the enrollment process.
- **Efficient Management:** Tools and functionalities for administrators to efficiently manage and track enrollments.
